# DRL Battery Cycle Optimisation

Deep reinforcement learning for battery cycle connected to the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). Market data comes from AEMO via
[`nemosis`](https://github.com/UNSW-CEEM/NEMOSIS).

## Setup

Dependencies live in `pyproject.toml` and are pinned in `uv.lock`, so both paths below
install the same versions. `flake.nix` additionally pins the interpreter and system
libraries to a fixed nixpkgs revision, making the whole environment reproducible.

With Nix (fully pinned):

```bash
nix develop
uv sync
```

Without Nix: [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), then:

```bash
uv sync
```

`uv` fetches its own CPython, so no system Python is needed. Requires Python >= 3.12.

To add a dependency, put it in `pyproject.toml` and run `uv lock`.

## Running

Run the LP oracle over a price window:

```bash
uv run python -m cli lp 2024-01-10 2024-01-11 --no-calendar
uv run python -m cli lp --help
```

Tests:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

## Data

`nemosis` downloads AEMO archive files into `data_cache/` on first use, so the first run
for a date range is slow and network-bound; later runs are local. The directory is
gitignored and safe to delete.

## Licence

MIT. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).
